This is a pure C# wrapper for libcurl.

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
The entire libcurl API has not been exposed.  Just enough to provide a proof of concept has been completed.  See the Samples for completed functionality.

LibCurlDotNet does not require a C library to function.  It is pure C#.
It is based on http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcurl-net/.
Of course see http://curl.haxx.se/ for more details on libcurl.
